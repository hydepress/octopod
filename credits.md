This Gem is sitting on the shoulder of giants, most of the code was not written
by me and/or depends on other code.

Especially to be mentioned:

* Arne Eilermann arne@kleinerdrei.net who started and created Octopod https://github.com/pattex/octopod
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
* [The whole Podlove project](http://podlove.org)
* [Octopress](http://octopress.org)

The beautiful Octopod Logo was designed and created by [Thekla "TeMeL" LÃ¶hr](http://www.temel-art.de/). 
Please support her with a little flattr.
