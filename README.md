# Octopod Documentation (Reformatted Book Edition)

by Stefan Haslinger et al

See the live version @ [`hydepress.github.io/octopod`](http://hydepress.github.io/octopod) 


> **Note:** The book edition is still an early release and a work-in-progess.


This is the [(official) documentation](https://github.com/jekyll-octopod/jekyll-octopod.github.io)
for Octopod reformatted in a single-page book edition.

See the [source repo](https://github.com/hydepress/hydepress.github.io) for how
the book gets auto-built with "plain" Jekyll - of course - and hosted on GitHub Pages.
