title: Prerequisites
---

The [Ruby programming language](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and
its package manager [Bundler](http://bundler.io).

Nice installation guides for the different operating systems can be found at the
[Rails Girls Website](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install).
You can stop right before installing Rails, because we do not depend on Ruby on Rails here.

You can check if you succeeded by entering

```
$ ruby -v
$ gem -v
```

at the command prompt. Both commands should return version greater or equal 2.0 .
