title: Installation

First, install jekyll, create a new application and cd into it:

```
$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll new name-of-my-podcast
$ cd name-of-my-podcast
```

Create a file `Gemfile` with the contents:

```
source 'http://rubygems.org'
gem 'jekyll-octopod'
```

This way, we tell Jekyll that we want to use Jekyll-Octopod. Now we install the Jekyll-Octopod and its dependencies and run the setup script via:

```
$ bundle install
$ octopod setup
```

The setup script copies all assets (for example the theme and templates) into your project. You should be prompted to overwrite a view files that are generated by `Jekyll`. If you answer the first question with capital `Y`, you wonâ€™t be asked again and all files are copied in batch.

Finally, generate the site and test drive it:

```
$ octopod build
$ octopod serve
```
